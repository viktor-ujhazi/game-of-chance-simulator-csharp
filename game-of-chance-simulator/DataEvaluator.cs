/*
    - DataEvaluator contains the constructor: DataEvaluator(HistoricalDataSet, ILogger). 
        Note: there can be more constructors which can declare more parameters if required.
    - DataEvaluator contains a public method that evaluates historical data points in order 
        to generate a result object: Result Run(). Note: calling the method uses the data 
        evaluator's state (the data points it was supplied during its construction) to do 
        some calculation in order to be able to create a Result instance. E.g. in a horse race 
        simulator it counts and determines which horse won first place most frequently and what's 
        the percentage of winning when betting on that horse. Important: keep it dead simple, 
        creating a game with convulated logic is not the point.
